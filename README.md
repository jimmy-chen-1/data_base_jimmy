## About Me

Enthusiastic and self-motivated to learn knowledge in the area of finance and data science. Eager to join a big company and bring my skills in financial analysis, and programming to every project that will be received in the future. A previous project for TTG Asia Media Pte Ltd (https://ttgasiamedia.com) resulted in an increase in traffic of downstream customers and performance improvement by 33.5%.

Furthermore, I am capable of performing effectively in the field of computing. In China, I received a patent for inventing a business management system in Python (please see the end of my resume for more information). As a result, I can demonstrate a broad knowledge of commerce and computer science.
